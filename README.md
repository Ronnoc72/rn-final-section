<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>All these projects were created using react native with expo. These projects were completed with the help from Maximillian's latter part of his course on react native. (SIDENOTE: There were more projects that I could have created from the course; I only didn't finish them because they were concepts that I had already learned before)</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h5>Expenses App</h5>
    <p>This application exercises more advance concepts on user input. It tracks the expenses of the user with a form. It totals the money that the user        has spent in the last 7 days and for all time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Favorite Places App</h5>
    <p>This application is the biggest app to this point, loaded with advanced features such as camera, location, and sqlite database. The app let's the        user document the places that they have been, allowing them to take pictures and set the location of where the user is at.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Push Notifications App</h5>
    <p>This is the most bare bones application. The only thing that it can do is send local and push notifications to the device that the user is using.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
